This repository contains my final code for the Text Adventure Game.

## Usage

To run the program, use `lein run core.clj` from the command line. (inside the adventure directory)

## Preview:
In this text adventure game, an evil computer scientist has trapped all your friends in a cyber prison. You must rescue your friends.
The setting is the familiar Siebel Center. 
You start out near the staircase on the 1st floor. 
At any time, enter 'help' to get a list of actions. 
Enter 'status' to get the status.


## Solution:
Here are the answers to the three puzzles:
1. mary
2. secret
3. name

## Sample Solution:
Here is a sample instruction stream that would work:
`pickup note`
`read note`
`south`
`get laptop`
`get phone`
`read notification`
`east`
`pickup all_access_pass`
`west`
`north`
`north`
`get bagel`
`get coffee`
`eat bagel`
`drink coffee`
`north`
`get first_question`
`read first_question`
`interact`
`south`
`south`
`downstairs`
`south`
`get second_question`
`read second_question`
`north`
`upstairs`
`upstairs`
`chill`
`north`
`north`
`interact`
`get third_question`
`south`
`west`
`enter`
`use all_access_pass`
`answer`
`mary`
`secret`
`name`
`release`


This is a very short solution. Other than this there are a lot of other opportunities to explore the building and even outside the building.

Hope you enjoy it.
